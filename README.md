# Learning using GitHub
GitHub has made me learn so much in the previous weeks and I am still in the process of learning.

## What I appreciate about Git
What I admire about this tool is that it promotes and supports distant and group coding. My codes can be seen by my team members and they can create pull requests to let me know what is wrong with my file and how I can rectify it. I can view my previous codes as my all commits get saved and I don't have to worry about saving them everytime.

## Learning about test files
I also learned about how I can use test files to check if my code is perfect. It provides user with score on their code in the prompt which reflects their code's accuracy. 

## Error rectification with expected output
Another feature which I despised in the beginning but started fancying as I preceeded with using this tool was heading to the 'Actions' button and checking my errors. In VS code, it shows the error right away which Git doesn't but what I liked is that it also tells the user about the expected input and the user input. It has aided me many times in writing the right code.

## My confusions
The other day I created a respository to practice coding on Git and it all worked fine for me but I wasn't able to check my code due to lack of test file which created confusion. I would really want to learn how to create test files to write codes in a better way or learn about different ways through which I can test it without files.
